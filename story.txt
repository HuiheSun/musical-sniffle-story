Once a upon a time, there is a grasshoper named Staffle living in a small human village. One day he was caught by a naughty farm boy who sniffles a lot. He was very sad and he cried for help. His friends and families heard him and wanted to rescue him from the naughty boy, so they got together outside the farm boy's house and sang really loud. The boy was greedy and he wanted to catch more grasshopers so he left the little grasshoper Staffle to catch more grasshopers. Once he left the poor Staffle, Staffle got rescued by his fellow friends. 
Rescuing a grasshoper from a human boy's hands is never a easy thing for tiny creatures like grasshopers. Therefore, in memorial of this great deed, other insects called this great action the MUSIC-SNIFFLE act in memorial of the great bravery and brotherly love among them.

Xiaotian's addition: The MUSIC-SNIFFLE act made kids in the human village feel grasshoppers' bravery and love. They no longer caught or harmed Staffle and his friends. They often had fun with the grasshopper and fed them. However, one day, farmers began to use pesticides for protecting their crops. 

Trevin's addition: The pesticides made Staffle and his friends sick, so they had to leave the village. The villagers noticed they left and wondered why. Eventually they realized the pesticides
were harming them and stopped using them.

Connor's addition: Hannah wrote alot.
